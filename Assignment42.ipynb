Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables and interpret the result.\n\nTo calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores, we can use the formula:\n r=  ‚àë(Xi- X)(Yi-Y)/ root over(‚àë(Xi-X)^2 (Yi-Y)^2)\n\nwhere: Xi and Yi are the individual data points (study time and exam scores).\nX and Y are the means of the study time and exam scores.\n                                                                                                                                           \nOnce we calculate this, interpret the result:\n\nr=1: Perfect positive linear relationship.\nr=‚àí1: Perfect negative linear relationship.\nr=0: No linear relationship.\n                                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                           \n# Q2.

You collected data on both variables for 50 participants. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman's rank correlation between these two variables and compare the results.\n\nPearson correlation coefficient for exercise and BMI is calculated using the formula for Pearson correlation. It measures the linear relationship between\nhours of exercise and BMI. Spearman's rank correlation would be calculated by ranking the exercise hours and BMI values and using the formula for Spearman's rank correlation.\n\nInterpret the results:\nIf Pearson's coefficient is positive, it suggests that as exercise increases, BMI also increases (linear).\nIf Spearman's coefficient is positive, it indicates a monotonic relationship; however, it doesn't require linearity.\n\nCompare both results:\nIf Pearson's and Spearman's values are close, it suggests a strong linear and monotonic relationship.\nA larger difference between Pearson and Spearman indicates a non-linear but still monotonic relationship.",

A survey was conducted to examine the relationship between age and preference for a particular brand of soft drink.\n\nThe data provided shows categorical preferences for soft drinks and their associated ages.

Instead, this scenario suggests analyzing the relationship between age (a numeric variable) and soft drink \npreference (a categorical variable).\n\nWe could:\nGroup the data by soft drink preference and calculate summary statistics (e.g., mean, median age for each drink preference).\nPerform a chi-square test for independence if you have more data in a contingency table format to examine the association between age categories and soft drink preference.\nVisualize the data, such as a bar chart showing soft drink preferences for different age ranges.\n\n# Q6.
